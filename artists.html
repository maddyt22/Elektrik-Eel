                    <p>One of techno's most influential figures, Richie Hawtin played an essential role in developing
                        the sound of minimal techno, as well as spreading its popularity throughout the global club
                        scene. Most famous for his experimental acid techno productions as Plastikman, including the
                        classic albums Musik (1994) and Consumed (1998), he is equally well-regarded for his
                        groundbreaking live sets and mix CDs (especially 1999's Decks, EFX &#38 909) which utilize
                        cutting-edge DJ technology, fusing loops of techno records with additional synthesizers and drum
                        machines. Initially based in Windsor, Ontario and connected with the techno scene in nearby
                        Detroit, he co-founded the highly influential Plus 8 (and its harder sublabel Probe Records)
                        along with John Acquaviva, later establishing Minus and relocating to Berlin during the early
                        2000s, just as minimal techno began receiving mainstream exposure. Hawtin has continued pushing
                        the limits of technology, developing highly conceptual events which are often intertwined with
                        the art world, such as a 2013 performance at the Guggenheim Museum in New York City which
                        resulted in Plastikman's
                        EX album.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>Detroit native Robert Hood is often regarded as the creator of minimal techno, though his vision
                        of the style is much bolder, more spiritually aware, and more socially conscious than most of
                        its other practitioners. The producer and DJ was an early member, along with Jeff Mills and Mike
                        Banks, of the Underground Resistance collective, whose influential releases throughout the first
                        half of the '90s helped change the face of Detroit techno and sparked a creative renaissance.
                        Initially producing solo material under pseudonyms like the Vision, Hood began using his own
                        name for releases such as 1994's genre-defining Minimal Nation and the more melodic, downtempo
                        Nighttime World, Vol. 1 in 1995. Hood's disco-influenced house tracks appeared under the name
                        Floorplan, while more abstract, minimal material made up his output as Monobox. He continued
                        delivering well-received studio albums including Point Blank (2002) and Motor: Nighttime World,
                        Vol. 3 (2012) in addition to volumes of the Fabric (2008) and DJ-Kicks (2018) mix series.
                        Floorplan's output since the early 2010s has reflected Hood's devout Christian faith, often
                        incorporating gospel samples; in 2016, the project became a duo with the addition of Robert's
                        daughter, Lyric Hood. Concurrently with his activities as half of Floorplan, he's continued
                        issuing inspired and experimental solo material, including 2020's Mirror Man and 2021's
                        Regenerate (as Monobox).</p>

                    <p>One of the pioneers of the Birmingham sound, U.K. techno artist Anthony Child has built a solid
                        and innovative catalog of minimal dancefloor techno under the name Surgeon. Compared favorably
                        with Detroit original Jeff Mills from his earliest Downwards singles on forward, Child's tracks
                        were a mainstay in the popular Motor City DJ's sets. A trio of classic late-'90s full-lengths
                        for Tresor (Basictonalvocabulary, Balance, and Force + Form) incorporated industrial and
                        Krautrock influences into hard, driving techno. He continually pushed the limits of analogue
                        equipment with increasingly complex releases on his own Dynamic Tension label, including 2011's
                        Breaking the Frame and 2018's Luminosity Device. He returned to Tresor in 2023 with Crash
                        Recoil, a more direct album inspired by his live performances.</p>

                    <p>One of Spain's premier techno DJs, Oscar Mulero is also an accomplished producer who founded his
                        own label, Warm Up, and occasionally released music on prestigious techno labels including
                        Theory Recordings and Tresor. Based in Madrid, Mulero got into music during the 1980s, initially
                        British goth rock bands such as the Cure, Joy Division, Sisters of Mercy, and Fields of the
                        Nephilim, followed later in the decade by electronic body music (EBM) acts such as Front 242,
                        Nitzer Ebb, and A Split Second. Around the turn of the decade, Mulero established himself as a
                        popular techno DJ in Madrid, first as a resident at the New World club and then, more notably,
                        as a resident at another pioneering Madrid techno club, the Omen. His style at the time was
                        based upon Detroit techno (e.g. Underground Resistance) and the IDM sound of Warp (e.g. Aphex
                        Twin), as well as the German hard trance of Harthouse (e.g. Hardfloor) and the ambient output of
                        Fax +49-69/450464 (e.g. Pete Namlook). In time his style would fall more in line with the
                        productions of Jeff Mills and Surgeon.</p>

                    <p>A prolific, beloved member of the German techno community, Weimar-based producer/DJ Gabor
                        Schablitzki released a wide assortment of EPs throughout the late '90s and 2000s as DJ Robag,
                        Die Dub Rolle, Machiste, Robag Wruhme als Themroc, Robag Wruhme als Rolf Oksen, and, most
                        commonly, Robag Wruhme. While the 2005 Wruhme album Wuzzelbud KK, issued on Musik Krause, was a
                        set of predominantly all-new tracks, it provided something of a gateway into Schablitzki's work,
                        offering not just streamlined techno that clicked, roiled, and wobbled, but downtempo hip-hop as
                        well. An alliance with Sören Bodner was dubbed the Wighnomy Brothers; the two DJ'd under the
                        name, and Schablitzki used the alias as an outlet for some of his most popular productions —
                        alternately foreboding and rollicking tracks like "Wurz + Blosse" (Kompakt Extra, 2004),
                        "Wombat" (Kompakt Extra, 2005), and "Moppal Kiff" (Freude Am Tanzen, 2006). Under the Wighnomy
                        name, Schablitzki released Metawuffmischfelge (Freude Am Tanzen, April 2008), an elaborately
                        layered mix of contemporary minimal techno. He followed it with Wuppdeckmishmampflow (Kompakt,
                        January 2011), a relatively subdued set. Another mixed set, Olgamikks (Natchtdigital, August
                        2012), showcased some of Wruhme's remix work.Pic:</p>

                    <p>A superstar Du, sought-after producer, taste-making label owner, and wizard behind Major Lazer,
                        Diplo (aka Diplodocus, Wes Diplo, and Wes Gully) launched his career on the fringes of dance
                        music.
                        With his mash-up mixtapes, he found and created a sound where his musical tastes -- '80s pop,
                        electronica, Dirty South hip-hop, and his major influence, Miami bass music -- intersect. His
                        attention-grabbing projects Hollertronix, with partner DJ Low Budget, and the 2004 Piracy Funds
                        Terrorism, Vol. 1 mixtape with British-Sri Lankan MC M.I.A., made a heavy impact on the
                        alternative electro-pop scene, amassing rave reviews from music critics and indie kids alike.
                        Later, his Mad Decent imprint presented the edge of pop, hip-hop, and dance music while his
                        conceptual Major Lazer project mixed dancehall with rave culture and toured the globe as a
                        live-party sound system. By the late 2010s, high-profile projects with Skrillex (Jack Ü) and
                        Mark Ronson (Silk City) both yielded Grammy wins for collaborations with Justin Bieber and Dua
                        Lipa, respectively. He also teamed with Labrinth and Sia to form the supergroup LSD. Heading
                        into the 2020s, the versatile artist segued into territories ranging from country to ambient,
                        focusing on house music through his Higher Ground imprint and his 2022 self-titled full-length,
                        then developing a parallel country-pop path with his Diplo Presents Thomas Wesley albums, which
                        arrived in 2020 and 2023, respectively.</p>

                    <p>France's Hadrien Federiconi (aka Feder) is an electronic dance music
                        DJ and producer known for his minimalist deep house and atmospheric pop. Born in 1987 in Nice,
                        Feder first began producing at age 20 while living in London. After a year abroad, he moved back
                        to France to study sound engineering and settled in Paris. It was there that he first gained
                        attention for his various remixes, including his 2014 version of the Rodríguez song "Can't Get
                        Away," which charted atop the music blog aggregator Hype Machine. Also around this time, he
                        released the Krad Records EP Vampiros Energeticos and signed to Atlantic
                        Warner Records. In 2015, he earned his first number one single in France and Switzerland with
                        his original song "Goodbye," featuring singer Lyse. Several more well-received tracks followed,
                        including "Blind" with Emmi and "Lordly" featuring Alex Aiono. In 2017, Feder delivered the
                        R&B-inflected single
                        "Back for More," showcasing London-based vocalist Daecolm, and in 2018 he issued "Control,"
                        which featured Bryce Vine and Dan Caplen.</p>

                    <p>Lost Frequencies has soared to success in the international music industry over the past
                        half-decade. First on the scene in 2014 with his global smash 'Are You With Me' which saw him
                        flip an Easton Corbin, Country-style classic into a pop-meets-dance dose of originality, firmly
                        cementing his name on the global stage. 'Are You With Me' would secure the #1 spot in 18
                        countries and see him become the first Belgian artist to hit #1 in the U.K. Fast forward to
                        2023, where he earned his first Brit Award nomination for 'Best International Song' for the
                        global hit with Callum Scott 'Where Are You Now'. As well as hitting #1 on The Official Big Top
                        40 U.K. and The Official Ireland Top 50 charts after becoming the most-played song in the U.K.,
                        the single would also achieve Platinum status across 14 territories worldwide. 'Where Are You
                        Now' also secured a Top 30 U.S. chart position and, to date, has received over 1.5 billion
                        combined streams. The 'Alive &#38 Feeling Fine' album preceded the announcement of his first
                        full-live tour, Lost Frequencies Live, bringing his whole body of music to life in a live
                        environment. Continuing up to the tail-end of 2022, Lost Frequencies Live toured extensively to
                        sold-out dates throughout North America and Europe with 20 shows over three months, accumulating
                        in a dazzling spectacle at Forest National Brussels.

                    <p>Will Sparks' name has forever shaped the global electronic dance music scene. Pioneering
                        Melbourne Bounce, a sub-genre of EDM affectionately named after his Australian hometown; making
                        countless laps around the globe playing the world's most reputable stages including Ultra Music
                        Festival, Creamfields and Tomorrowland as well as residencies at some of the best global venues.
                        Will is finding himself time and time again at the top of the dance music charts with double
                        Platinum records and amassing an inconceivable 2.8 million monthly listeners on Spotify all
                        before the ripe young age of 28, Sparks knew there was something more to life for him from a
                        very young age, and boy did the industry know that too.
                        The double Platinum producer has shaken up the charts as much as he's shaken up the streaming
                        world. After releasing his iconic 'Ah Yeah', the track shot straight up the charts and
                        effortlessly hit double platinum. Still riding the wave of his first release's success, Sparks
                        then dropped 'Bring it Back. Since these two hits, Will has continued to triumph, today amassing
                        over 600million+ streams just across Spotify, Apple Music and YouTube.</p>

                    <p>Meet the man who’s single-handedly reinventing disco. It’s not often that you find a 19-year-old
                        producer referencing Earth, Wind and Fire as his favourite act. That’s exactly the case with
                        explosive new talent Throttle, the teenager from Australia who’s racked up an alarming list of
                        achievements over the past three years and who – with the official backing of Earth, Wind and
                        Fire – is set to scale the heights even further with new single “September”.
                        “Dirty Disco” pioneer Throttle is the only artist ever to have been allowed by the band to use
                        original music from their body of work, a fact that may surprise more mainstream media
                        unfamiliar with his work. Yet in an embarrassingly short space of time and at a ferocious pace,
                        the young Australian is rising to the top armed with advanced studio finesse, his beloved guitar
                        and a clear idea of where dance music needs to go. Throttle is not just the new kid on the block
                        – he is the future of the genre and beyond – way, way beyond.</p>
